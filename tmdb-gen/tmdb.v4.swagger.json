The series stars Jim Caviezel as John Reese, a presumed dead former CIA agent who is approached by a mysterious billionaire named Harold Finch (Michael Emerson) to prevent violent crimes before they happen by using an advanced surveillance system dubbed \"The Machine\". Their unique brand of vigilante justice attracts the attention of two NYPD officers, Joss Carter (Taraji P. Henson) and Lionel Fusco (Kevin Chapman), whom Reese uses to his advantage as he investigates persons of interest. Reese and Finch are later aided by Samantha \"Root\" Groves (Amy Acker), a highly intelligent computer hacker and contract killer who the Machine later identifies as its \"analog interface\" and Sameen Shaw (Sarah Shahi), a former ISA assassin who unknowingly dealt with the \"relevant\" numbers found by the Machine.",

Months later he awakens with the power of super speed, granting him the ability to move through Central City like an unseen guardian angel. Though initially excited by his newfound powers, Barry is shocked to discover he is not the only \"meta-human\" who was created in the wake of the accelerator explosion -- and not everyone is using their new powers for good. Barry partners with S.T.A.R. Labs and dedicates his life to protect the innocent. For now, only a few close friends and associates know that Barry is literally the fastest man alive, but it won't be long before the world learns what Barry Allen has become...The Flash.",

The series revolves around a group of friends in the New York City borough of Manhattan. The series was produced by Bright/Kauffman/Crane Productions, in association with Warner Bros. Television. The original executive producers were Crane, Kauffman, and Kevin S. Bright, with numerous others being promoted in later seasons.\n\nKauffman and Crane began developing Friends under the title Insomnia Cafe in November/December 1993. They presented the idea to Bright, with whom they had previously worked, and together they pitched a seven-page treatment of the series to NBC. After several script rewrites and changes, including a second title change to Friends Like Us, the series was finally named Friends and premiered on NBC's coveted Thursday 8:30 pm timeslot. Filming for the series took place at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California in front of a live studio audience. The series finale, airing on May 6, 2004, was watched by 52.5 million American viewers, making it the fourth most watched series finale in television history and the most watched episode of the decade.",

The original executive producers were Crane, Kauffman, and Kevin S. Bright, with numerous others being promoted in later seasons.\n\nKauffman and Crane began developing Friends under the title Insomnia Cafe in November/December 1993. They presented the idea to Bright, with whom they had previously worked, and together they pitched a seven-page treatment of the series to NBC. After several script rewrites and changes, including a second title change to Friends Like Us, the series was finally named Friends and premiered on NBC's coveted Thursday 8:30 pm timeslot. Filming for the series took place at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California in front of a live studio audience. The series finale, airing on May 6, 2004, was watched by 52.5 million American viewers, making it the fourth most watched series finale in television history and the most watched episode of the decade.",

The series revolves around a group of friends in the New York City borough of Manhattan. The series was produced by Bright/Kauffman/Crane Productions, in association with Warner Bros. Television. The original executive producers were Crane, Kauffman, and Kevin S. Bright, with numerous others being promoted in later seasons.\n\nKauffman and Crane began developing Friends under the title Insomnia Cafe in November/December 1993. They presented the idea to Bright, with whom they had previously worked, and together they pitched a seven-page treatment of the series to NBC. After several script rewrites and changes, including a second title change to Friends Like Us, the series was finally named Friends and premiered on NBC's coveted Thursday 8:30 pm timeslot. Filming for the series took place at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California in front of a live studio audience. The series finale, airing on May 6, 2004, was watched by 52.5 million American viewers, making it the fourth most watched series finale in television history and the most watched episode of the decade.",

The series revolves around a group of friends in the New York City borough of Manhattan. The series was produced by Bright/Kauffman/Crane Productions, in association with Warner Bros. Television. The original executive producers were Crane, Kauffman, and Kevin S. Bright, with numerous others being promoted in later seasons.\n\nKauffman and Crane began developing Friends under the title Insomnia Cafe in November/December 1993. They presented the idea to Bright, with whom they had previously worked, and together they pitched a seven-page treatment of the series to NBC. After several script rewrites and changes, including a second title change to Friends Like Us, the series was finally named Friends and premiered on NBC's coveted Thursday 8:30 pm timeslot. Filming for the series took place at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California in front of a live studio audience. The series finale, airing on May 6, 2004, was watched by 52.5 million American viewers, making it the fourth most watched series finale in television history and the most watched episode of the decade.",
